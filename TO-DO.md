##To-Do List:

* well since new html/css is out, i guess i should at least just update this style, right?

***

* quick reply (wait for redesign)
* /f/, /rs/ and other sub-domains
* implication styling (still not happy with this)
* spoilers (fix up `.unkfunc` and `::selection`)
* stubs (they need class names to make it easier :()

##Other Nit-Picking

* chrumb support
	* fucking checkboxes
* vanilla 4chan support
* unify style a bit more
	* check colours
	* maybe get a global reset going?
	* add tab spacing, tidy up css
	* use less?
	* get users to disable static.4chan styles?
* dark as my souls version
* learn how to use options on userstyles
* custom icons?
	* sticky, locked
* get rid of the shitty boards from `#navtop` (use 4chan s?)
* look into fixing `#navtop` positioning issues (clicking on a quote link, gets covered up because of navtop's `position: fixed`, changed because nav is now hidden) (maybe with 4chan s)
* turn all those tables into block elements
* fix the line-height for EVERYTHING
* get rid of each thread having `br[clear=left]` and using `clear:both;` or `display:block` (dhurr but what about vanilla 4chan!)
