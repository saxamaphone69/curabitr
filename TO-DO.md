##To-Do List:

* image expanding
* quick reply (change inputs, support mayhem and aerosmith)
* /f/, /rs/ and other sub-domains
* `.filetitle`, `.replytitle` styling
* implication styling (still not happy with this)
* spoilers (fix up `.unkfunc` and ::selection)
* stubs (needs class names)

##Other Nit-Picking

* why must chrome be so... 2nd place ;___; [long live firefox \o\ \o/ /o/]
* vanilla 4chan support
* unify style a bit more
	* check colours
	* maybe get a global reset going?
	* add tab spacing, tidy up css
* dark as my souls version
* learn how to use options on userstyles
* custom icons?
	* make the gradient from the noise longer
	* sticky, locked, refresh, file upload
* get rid of the shitty boards from `#navtop` (use 4chan s?)
* look into fixing `#navtop` positioning issues (clicking on a quote link, gets covered up because of navtop's `position: fixed`, changed because nav is now hidden)
* turn all those tables into block elements
* fix the line-height for EVERYTHING
* get rid of each thread having `br[clear=left]` and using `clear:both;` or `display:block` (dhurr but what about vanilla 4chan!)
