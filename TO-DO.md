##the never ending to do list

i'm just creating more work for myself, and that's why i've never called this "finished", per say

i've been adding stuff to the list (and just never doing it) for a very long time now. really, 3.5 is done. anything more is just updates and whatever

https://github.com/saxamaphone69/curabitr/issues/5 - this list sort of crosses over, but here's another list from one of my notebooks:

* webfonts
* make a stylesheet for the catalogue, or make the adblock filter not work on the catalogue
* don't worry about comments in the stylesheet (nobody reads my shit anyway)
* fuck mascots (i don't use it and it's tacky as fuck)
* /f/ is a whole 'nother issue. /rs/ is a different domain, and i never go there (and if i did, it would not be affected by css)
* spoilers in terms of links, hover, selection and greentext
* unify ems/rems and colours
* DAMS needs a cookie/to be saaved
* add screenshots + install page to readme
* mediaa that works and looks good
* keyframes for new posts
* 4chan s work, and mentioned in the readme
