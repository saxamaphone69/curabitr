##To-Do List:

* `.replyhl`
* image expanding
* updater
* quote Preview (hover over backlinks + don't forget border/outline)
* quick Reply
* /f/, /rs/ and other sub-domains
* `.filetitle`, `.replytitle` styling
* implication styling
* spoilers
* `.omittedposts`
* stubs

##Other nit-picking

* chrome support
	* make anything that is `font-size: 0;` also `color: transparent;`
* vanilla 4chan support
* unify style a bit more
	* check colours
	* maybe get a global reset going?
	* add tab spacing, tidy up css
* dark as my souls version
* learn how to use options on userstyles
* custom icons?
	* make the gradient from the noise longer
* get rid of the shitty boards from `#navtop`
* look into fixing `#navtop` positioning issues (clicking on a quote link, gets covered up because of navtop's `position: fixed`
* turn all those tables into block elements
* fix the line-height for EVERYTHING
* get rid of each thread having `br[clear=left]` and using `clear:both;` or `display:block`
