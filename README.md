#curabitr v3.5

__curabitr__ is an aesthetically pleasing userstyle for [4chan](http://www.4chan.org), created by Saxamaphone !3.saxN0DHY. I also created [3 Shades of 4chan](http://userstyles.org/styles/23586/3-shades-of-4chan) and a few other styles.

##Install

For __curabitr__ to work as intended, you need to block the default 4chan stylesheets. This is the method I use:

Through Adblock Plus, add this custom filter:

```
*//static.4chan.org/image/title/*
*//static.4chan.org/css/*
*//static.4chan.org/js/prettify/prettify.css
```

You will also need the latest version of [Mayhem's 4chan X](https://4chan-x.just-believe.in/) for this userstyle to function as intended. Support for other forks might be done in the future. Might not work with all settings.

To install __curabitr__ for 4chan, you'll need the [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/stylish) add-on/extension for either Firefox or Chrome.

__curabitr__ will be hosted here only and will no longer be on userstyles.org. [Hopefully I can get auto-updating to work at some point](http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/2247/load-in-stylish-button-for-my-own-site).

##Important Notes

__curabitr__ is being developed in Nightly first, and just hoping it works in Firefox and Chrome second. If something isn't working, please open a new issue, but generally it should work cross-browser.

__curabitr__ will not work as intended with the default 4chan extension or vanilla 4chan.
