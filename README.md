#curabitr v3.5

__curabitr__ is a userstyle for [4chan](http://www.4chan.org), created by Saxamaphone !3.saxN0DHY. I also created [3 Shades of 4chan](http://userstyles.org/styles/23586/3-shades-of-4chan) and a few other styles.

##Install

For curabitr to work as intended, you need to block the default 4chan stylesheets. This method is what I use:

Through Adblock Plus, add this custom filter:

`*//static.4chan.org/image/title/*`
`*//static.4chan.org/css/*`

Now you're saving yourself page requests and precious downloads!

You also need the latest version of 4chan X (at the time of writing, version 3) for this userstyle to function. Might not work with all settings.

To install curabitr for 4chan, you'll need the [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/stylish) add-on/extension for either Firefox or Chrome.

curabitr will only be hosted here and will no longer be on userstyles.org.

##Notes

curabitr is being developed in Nightly first, and just hoping it works in Firefox and Chrome second. If something isn't working, please open a new issue.

curabitr will not work with the default 4chan extension or vanilla 4chan.
