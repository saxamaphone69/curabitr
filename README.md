#Regarding new HTML/CSS

Yes, I am aware. I'll update the style so it is, at the very least, usable. I've sorta stopped bothering with this since I never really got feedback for it.

__curabitr__ is a userstyle for [4chan](http://www.4chan.org), created by Saxamaphone !3.saxN0DHY. I also created [3 Shades of 4chan](http://userstyles.org/styles/23586/3-shades-of-4chan) but I haven't updated that in *forever*.

##Install
To install curabitr for 4chan, you'll need the [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/stylish) add-on/extension for either Firefox or Chrome.

You have a choice; you install the [version that is on userstyles.org](http://userstyles.org/styles/54699/curabitr) or you [go raw and get it as it updates](https://raw.github.com/saxamaphone69/curabitr/master/curabitr.css).

##IMPORTANT

__This is being developed in Nightly/Firefox first, Chrome second. So, if something doesn't look right in Chrome, tell me so I can fix it. Opera is not supported (sorry to the 5 people using it).__

__At this point in time, [4chan x](http://mayhemydg.github.com/4chan-x/) must be installed for the userstyle to function as intended. Vanilla 4chan support isn't a priority, because you should feel bad if you are limiting yourself.__
