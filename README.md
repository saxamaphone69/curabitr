#curabitr

__curabitr__ is a userstyle for [4chan](http://www.4chan.org), created by Saxamaphone !3.saxN0DHY. I also created [3 Shades of 4chan](http://userstyles.org/styles/23586/3-shades-of-4chan) but I haven't updated that in *forever*.

##Install
To install curabitr for 4chan, you'll need the [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/stylish) add-on/extension for either Firefox or Chrome (latest version of each). As of now, only Firefox is supported.
